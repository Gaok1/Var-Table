# Interpreter Java

The **Interpreter Java** is a command-line application written in Java that provides a simplified interpreter for a basic programming language. It allows users to execute commands for variable declaration, assignment, referencing, printing, and more.

## Features

### Variable Management
- **Declaration**: Declare variables with types such as integer (`int`), double (`double`), character (`char`), and their respective pointer types.
- **Assignment**: Assign values to variables of compatible types.
- **Referencing**: Create references between variables.
- **Printing**: Print the values of variables.
- **Removal**: Remove variables from the interpreter's variable table.

### Additional Commands
- **Screen Clearing**: Clear the console screen for better visibility.
- **Help**: Get assistance and view available commands.

## Supported Types

The interpreter supports the following types:
- **Integer**: `:int`
- **Double**: `:double`
- **Character**: `:char`
- **Integer Pointer**: `:int*`
- **Double Pointer**: `:double*`
- **Character Pointer**: `:char*`

## Usage

1. **Compile and Run**: Compile the Java files and execute the main `Interpreter` class.
2. **Enter Commands**: Input commands using the specified syntax for variable declaration, assignment, referencing, etc.
3. **Observe Output**: View the output generated by the interpreter as it executes the commands.

## Command Syntax

```java
let <type> <name>;
```

### Value Assignment
